/* 
Created by Antonis Karvelas, sdi1600060, for the 1st project of
K22: Operating Systems.
This is an implementation of a generic hash table, with each cell
in the table being the root of a red black tree.
I thought that would be interesting, as I've already implemented
red-black trees for this project.
